TEST THE WASM RELATED FILES, especially compare python file/function structure so functionality hasnt been omitted etc
Camera and sensor rust codes (wasm_utils.rs) need extra checking, not complete probably.

Is tempconfigs folder necessary?

---- Testing structure: ----
Simple tests for singular functions where needed. (unit testing)
Automate orchestrator testing. Two ways:
    1. Script that sends requests to supervisor, simulating ORCHESTRATOR
    2. Script that sends requests to orchestrator, simulating USER. This would also be usable for orchestrator porting.

Performance testing to compare python and rust implementations??

Is testcontainers useful?

-- Connecting supervisor to orchestrator --

1. Supervisor initializes, gets its own ip-address, port, etc ???
2. Once supervisor is ready (TODO: Check that there is a readiness check), broadcast mDns message to
orchestrator.
    * Orchestrator address is read from ???
    * POST http://<orchestrator_address>:<orchestrator_port>/file/device/discovery/register
3. Orchestrator fetches device description
    * Address ???
    * Returns ???

-- API for running WASM-modules --

???

-- Communication between orchestrator and supervisor --

???
